-- Migration: Add City Insights System
-- Run this to add insights functionality to existing database
-- Usage: psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrate-add-insights.sql

-- 1. Add insights column to cities table
ALTER TABLE cities ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS insights JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;

-- 2. Drop and recreate v_city_summary view with insights
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_city_summary CASCADE;

-- 4. Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mv_city_insights_city ON mv_city_insights(city_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mv_city_insights_continent ON mv_city_insights(continent);

-- 5. Update refresh function to include mv_city_insights
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_materialized_views()
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
