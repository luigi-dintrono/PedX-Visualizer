## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
User selects metric → FilterContext updates → InfoSidebar detects change
  → Fetches metric data from API → Fetches relationships from API
  → Renders Metric Mode with all sections
```

### Database Views Used
- `mv_global_insights` - Global baselines
- `mv_city_insights` - City rankings and metrics
- CSV files (weather_daytime_stats, gender_stats, vehicle_stats)

### Performance
- ⚡ Fast queries using materialized views
- ⚡ CSV data pre-processed and cached
- ⚡ Lazy loading (data fetched only when needed)
- ⚡ Efficient top-N queries

## 📝 Supported Metrics

1. **risky_crossing** - Risky Crossing Rate (%)
2. **run_red_light** - Run Red Light Rate (%)
3. **crosswalk_usage** - Crosswalk Usage Rate (%)
4. **phone_usage** - Phone Usage Rate (%)
5. **crossing_speed** - Crossing Speed (m/s)
6. **crossing_time** - Crossing Time (s)
7. **avg_age** - Average Age (years)
8. **pedestrian_density** - Pedestrian Density (peds/video)
9. **road_width** - Road Width (m)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the application in your browser**

3. **Test Empty Mode:**
   - Start with no selections
   - Verify "About" section and "Top Insights" display

4. **Test Metric Mode:**
   - Click "Search by behaviour..." in left sidebar
   - Select any metric (e.g., "Risky Crossing Rate")
   - Verify all sections render:
     - Header with metric info
     - Top Cities list
     - Key Relationships
     - Key Insights
     - All Cities table
   - Try clicking on different cities in the lists
   - Verify it switches to City Mode

5. **Test City Mode:**
   - Select a city from Metric Mode
   - Verify City Mode displays correctly
   - Click "All Cities" to deselect
   - Verify return to Empty Mode

6. **Test Metric Switching:**
   - Select one metric
   - Switch to another metric
   - Verify data updates correctly

   - Auto-refresh on new data
   - Push notifications

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Pre-existing)

The following linting errors exist in the codebase but are NOT related to the Metric Mode implementation:

- **filter-sidebar.tsx**: Type incompatibility between Slider component expecting `[number, number]` tuples but receiving `number[]` arrays from GranularFilters
  - This is a pre-existing issue requiring refactoring of the entire filter system
  - Does not affect functionality
  - Not in scope for this task

- **Other files**: Some files have unused variables and `any` types that pre-date this implementation

### Build Status: ⚠️ Builds successfully with pre-existing linting warnings

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

✅ Metric Mode triggers when behavior selected from filter sidebar  
✅ Displays metric name, unit, and description  
✅ Shows current filter summary chips  
✅ Lists top cities with rankings and delta vs global  
✅ Displays relationships/correlations  
✅ Shows auto-generated insights  
✅ Includes paginated/scrollable all cities table  
✅ Supports click-to-pin functionality  
✅ Maintains existing Empty Mode and City Mode  
✅ No new TypeScript/linting errors introduced  
✅ Comprehensive documentation provided  

## 🏁 Conclusion

The Metric Mode has been successfully implemented with all requested features. The implementation:

- Follows Next.js and React best practices
- Uses efficient database queries (materialized views)
- Provides an intuitive, responsive user interface
- Integrates seamlessly with existing filter system
- Includes comprehensive documentation
- Has zero new linting/TypeScript errors

The feature is **production-ready** and can be deployed after the pre-existing linting issues (which don't affect functionality) are addressed in a separate refactoring task.
